## Abstract
Anomaly detection (AD) identifies outliers for applications like defect and lesion detection. While CLIP shows promise for zero-shot AD tasks due to its strong generalization capabilities, its inherent **Anomaly-Unawareness** leads to limited discrimination between normal and abnormal features. To address this problem, we propose **Anomaly-Aware CLIP** (AA-CLIP), which enhances CLIP's anomaly discrimination ability in both text and visual spaces while preserving its generalization capability. AA-CLIP is achieved through a straightforward yet effective two-stage approach: it first creates anomaly-aware text anchors to differentiate normal and abnormal semantics clearly, then aligns patch-level visual features with these anchors for precise anomaly localization. This two-stage strategy, with the help of residual adapters, gradually adapts CLIP in a controlled manner, achieving effective AD while maintaining CLIP's class knowledge. Extensive experiments validate AA-CLIP as a resource-efficient solution for zero-shot AD tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in industrial and medical applications.

## Quick Start 
### 1. Installation  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mwxinnn/AA-CLIP.git
cd AA-CLIP
conda create -n aaclip python=3.10 -y  
conda activate aaclip  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
### 2. Datasets
The datasets can be downloaded from [MVTec-AD](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/), [VisA](https://github.com/amazon-science/spot-diff), [MPDD](https://github.com/stepanje/MPDD), [BrainMRI, LiverCT, Retinafrom](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1La5H_3tqWioPmGN04DM1vdl3rbcBez62?usp=sharing) from [BMAD](https://github.com/DorisBao/BMAD), [CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir, CVC-300](https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Polyp_DataSet_zip/21221579) from Polyp Dataset.

Put all the datasets under ``./data`` and use jsonl files in ``./dataset/metadata/``. You can use your own dataset and generate personalized jsonl files with below format:
```json
{"image_path": "xxxx/xxxx/xxx.png", 
 "label": 1.0 (for anomaly) # or 0.0 (for normal), 
 "class_name": "xxxx", 
 "mask_path": "xxxx/xxxx/xxx.png"}
```
The way of creating corresponding jsonl file differs, depending on the file structure of the original dataset. The basic logic is recording the path of every image file, mask file, anomaly label ``label``, and category name, then putting them together under a jsonl file.

(Optional) the base data directory can be edited in ``./dataset/constants``. If you want to reproduce the results with few-shot training, you can generate corresponding jsonl files and put them in ``./dataset/metadata/{$dataset}`` with ``{$shot}-shot.jsonl`` as the file name. For few-shot training, we use ``$shot`` samples from each category to train the model.

> Notice: Since the anomaly scenarios in VisA are closer to real situations, the default hyper-parameters are set according to the results trained on VisA. More analysis and discussion will be available.

### 3. Training & Evaluation
```bash
# training
python train.py --shot $shot --save_path $save_path
python train.py --training_mode full_shot --dataset MVTec --save_path ckpt/mvtec_change1.0
# evaluation
python test.py --save_path $save_path --dataset $dataset
# test_single_image
python single_image_test.py `
--image_path "D:\2019alitianchibei\dataset\xuelang_round1_train_part1_20180628\train_images\J01_2018.06.19 14_04_30.jpg" `
--class_name carpet `
--save_path ckpt/mvtec `
--model_name ViT-L-14-336 `
--img_size 518 `
--visualize
# (Optional) we provide bash script for training and evaluating all the datasets
bash scripts.sh
```
Model definition is in ``./model/``. We thank [```open_clip```](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip.git) for being open-source. To run the code, one has to download the weight of OpenCLIP ViT-L-14-336px and put it under ```./model/```.

## Additional Discussion
(I am writing down my experimental observations and thoughts. In this part, it is less formal and rigorous.)
We have observed several interesting phenomenons during our experiments:

### The impact of class-level supervision differs across domains.
In the initial stage of adapting the text encoder, we tried to apply binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss to directly distinguish between normal and anomalous text embeddings—an approach that imposes stronger supervision than our current method, which adds class embeddings to visual embeddings and relies on segmentation loss for separation. Experimental results indicate that BCE improves zero-shot performance on industrial datasets but negatively affects performance in the medical domain. This may be due to the lower diversity and simpler structure of anomaly representations in medical data, making them easier to learn without strong supervision.

### Adaptation hyper-parameters should be carefully tuned.
 Since CLIP is pre-trained on a massive dataset and anomaly detection is a comparatively simpler task, the model is prone to issues like catastrophic forgetting or overfitting. Careful control of the adaptation process is essential, which is why our method involves multiple hyper-parameters (though these can still be further optimized).

Additionally, the differences in anomaly patterns between the training dataset and downstream zero-shot datasets cannot be ignored. Overfitting to the anomaly characteristics of the training set can lead the model to rely on superficial cues. For instance, if the training data predominantly features round-shaped anomalies, the model may prioritize shape over true semantic understanding of anomalies. Incorporating training data with a wider variety of anomaly types could help mitigate this issue.
